# Algorithm breakdown
# Based on the value from IN.S, @2 will perform one of three
# operations: pass from IN.a (GETA), pass from IN.b (GETB)
# or pass the sum from IN.A and IN.B (GETAB)

@0


@1
MOV UP, RIGHT

@2
MOV UP, ACC # Get the value from IN.S
JGZ GETB 
JEZ GETAB
GETA:
MOV LEFT, ACC # pass from IN.A and discard other value
MOV RIGHT, NIL
JMP END
GETB:
MOV LEFT, NIL # pass from IN.B and discard other value
MOV RIGHT, ACC
JMP END
GETAB: # pass sum from IN.A + IN.B
ADD LEFT
ADD RIGHT
END: MOV ACC, DOWN
