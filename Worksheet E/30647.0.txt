# Based on the value of IN.A - IN.B determine the order
# in which the values should be passed

MOV UP, ACC
MOV ACC, RIGHT # pass the value twice: for subtraction
MOV ACC, RIGHT # and once for output 

@2
MOV UP, ACC
MOV ACC, RIGHT
SUB LEFT
JLZ BA # if B - A < 0 than B < A, therefore B is passed before A
AB:
