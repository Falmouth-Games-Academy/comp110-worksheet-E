# Algorithm Breakdown
# In node @4, perform the additions using the BAK memory
# In node @5, count the number of elements passed until a zero is passed


@0


@1
MOV UP, DOWN

@2


@3
MOV RIGHT, RIGHT # save the value

@4
MOV UP, ACC
JEZ EOSEQ # 0 marks the End Of SEQuence
MOV 1, RIGHT # add 1 to the length calculator
MOV ACC, LEFT
SWP
ADD LEFT # perform the addition
SWP
JMP END
EOSEQ:
MOV 0, RIGHT # tell the length node to output the length
SWP
MOV ACC, DOWN
MOV NIL, ACC
SWP
END:

@5
MOV LEFT, ACC
JEZ EOSEQ # End of Sequence marker
SWP
ADD 1 # increase length
SWP
JMP END
EOSEQ:
