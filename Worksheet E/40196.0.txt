# Algorithm breakdown
# @1 will pass either zero when finding non-zero numbers or the current number of consecutive zeroes found
# @4 will subtract 2 from what is passed (see above) and, if the number of consecutive zeroes passed is greater than 3, it will output 1, as a sequence of length 3 was found
