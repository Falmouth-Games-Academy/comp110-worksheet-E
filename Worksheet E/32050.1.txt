# Algorithm breakdown
# Based on the difference between 2 consecutive values
# we decide in which order to pass them (to avoid having to do 2 checks (a - b and b - a)
# and then compare the difference with 0 (+ 10)
# if the value is negative or 0, we return 1

MOV RIGHT, DOWN

@1 # passes each value twice: for subtraction and comparison
