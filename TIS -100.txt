TIS-100
ONE----
Objective: 
/* Manipulate the values between the nodes to output the values*/

Simple data manipulation, once I understood the naming practice and the basic commands 
mov, up, down, left, right. It was relatively simple (it also helped that the left hand section was already completed)

TWO----------
objective: Data manipulation /* double input values*/

Just needed to use the acc to add the same value to itself. Checked the manual regarding the add function,
 forntunately does exactly what is says on the tin. 
 
THREE----------
Objective /*Data manipulation, This was was a bit more of a problem, finally figured out the value read out on the left 
hand side*/

Used the sub and neg function this time, to change a negative value to a positive ( take one input from another
to mirror expected outputs). Use the NIL function to delay the right hand side values, to I could move down the correct 
input.  























































FOUR------------
Objective: /*allocate a set value to a particular output, also need to manipulation the values*/
Much more brain scratching.

Needed to stall certain values from entering the command node, so needed to have two sets of conditional commands and 
filter the values. I realised I could stall a value from entering the node by using NIL. And then use the conditional 
commands with jmp/JLZ,JEZ,JGZ (I had a problem with the logic and order of instructions. So decided to concentrate all 
the commands in one node.
