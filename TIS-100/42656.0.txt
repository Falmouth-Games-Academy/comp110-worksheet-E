MOV 0, RIGHT  # starts with moving 0 to the stack memory node, that the sequences are zero-terminated
S: MOV UP, ACC  # starts the loop with moving the next value to t he accumulator
JEZ Z  # checks if the value is 0 (end of a sequence)
MOV ACC, RIGHT  # if not, moves the accumulator to the memory node
JMP S  # starts "S" loop again
Z:MOV RIGHT, ACC  # if the value is 0, moves a value from the memory node to the accumulator
JEZ Y  # checks if this value is 0 (end of sequence again)
MOV ACC, DOWN  # if not, moves the accumulator down
JMP Z  # starts "Z" loop again
Y:MOV ACC, DOWN  # if the value from the memory node is 0, moves it down (this is to determine the end of a sequence)
