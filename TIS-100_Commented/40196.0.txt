JRO 2 # skip not command
NOT: MOV 0 DOWN # if its not 3 in a row move 0 down
START: MOV UP ACC # store first input
JNZ NOT # if not zero goto not
MOV 0 DOWN # if zero move zero down (these cover the fact that although its a zero its not 3 in a row yet)
MOV UP ACC 
JNZ NOT
MOV 0 DOWN
CONT: # used once we hit 2 zeros, if 3 in a row outputs 1 and checks the next input if not zero breaks the loop to not
MOV UP ACC
JNZ NOT
MOV 1 DOWN
