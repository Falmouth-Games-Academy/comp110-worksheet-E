MOV UP ACC # this loops to count how many times to multiply the number
START: JEZ END # if loop counter hits zero jmp and output 0
SUB 1 # if not 0 sub 1 from counter
MOV 1 RIGHT # move 1 right to tell node to add the number again
JMP START
END: MOV 0 RIGHT

@5
MOV UP ACC # bring in bas number
SAV # store it in bak so we can overwtire acc to check if we should add or not
MOV 0 RIGHT # move 0 right important so that we can add the base to something on first addition, or if no additions are made
ST: MOV LEFT ACC # grab input from loop counter
JEZ END # if 0 (no more loops) jump tot end
SWP # if not 0 swap to base number
MOV ACC RIGHT # move base number right
SWP # swap so the base is stored in bak again
MOV RIGHT ACC # grab base number from the stack
ADD RIGHT # add our stored multiplied number
MOV ACC RIGHT # move the new multiplied number back onto the stack
JMP ST # jmp to start to grab the next input from loop counter
END:MOV RIGHT DOWN  # move stored mulitplied value from stack to output
